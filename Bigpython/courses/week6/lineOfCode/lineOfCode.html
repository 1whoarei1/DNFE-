            <blockquote>
              <p>One way to measure the complexity of a program is to count its number of lines of code (LOC), excluding blank lines and comments. For instance, a program like</p>
              <img src="example.png" alt="">
              <p>has just two lines of code, not four, since its first line is a comment, and its second line is blank (i.e., just whitespace). Thatâ€™s not that many, so odds are the program isnâ€™t that complex. Of course, just because a program (or even function) has more lines of code than another doesnâ€™t necessarily mean itâ€™s more complex. For instance, a function like</p>
              <img src="example2.png" alt="">
              <p>isnâ€™t really twice as complex as a function like</p>
              <img src="example3.png" alt="">
              <p>even though the former has (more than) twice as many lines of code. In fact, the former might arguably be simpler if itâ€™s easier to read! So lines of code should be taken with a grain of salt.

                Even so, in a file called lines.py, implement a program that expects exactly one command-line argument, the name (or path) of a Python file, and outputs the number of lines of code in that file, excluding comments and blank lines. If the user does not specify exactly one command-line argument, or if the specified fileâ€™s name does not end in .py, or if the specified file does not exist, the program should instead exit via sys.exit.
                
                Assume that any line that starts with #, optionally preceded by whitespace, is a comment. (A docstring should not be considered a comment.) Assume that any line that only contains whitespace is blank.</p>
